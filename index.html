<p><b>Welcome to my website!</b></p>
<p>I am an assistant professor in the <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/aaec/">Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics</a> at <a href="https://www.ttu.edu/">Texas Tech University</a>. </p>

<p>I work in applied economics at the intersection of agriculture and the environment, with a particular emphasis on technology adoption, sustainability, and risk management. I am interested in analyzing the economic, psychological, and social information management dimensions of production choices in row-crop and grass-based agriculture. The objectives of my research are to provide information and identify policies that improve both economic profits and environmental management outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Research Interests:</b> Agricultural Production and Policy, Behavioral Economics, Environmental Economics, Risk Management </p>
