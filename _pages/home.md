Welcome to my website! I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/aaec/) at [Texas Tech University](https://www.ttu.edu/).

I am working broadly at the intersection of agriculture and the environment, with a particular emphasis on technology adoption, sustainability, and risk management. I am interested in analyzing the economic, psychological, and social information management dimensions of production choices in row-crop, grass, and livestock-based agriculture. The objectives of my research are to provide information and identify policies that improve both economic profits and environmental management outcomes.

I received my Ph.D. from Michigan State University, and was a postdoctoral research scholar at North Carolina State University prior to joining Texas Tech University.

<b>Research Interests:</b> Agricultural Production and Policy, Behavioral Economics, Environmental Economics, Risk Management
