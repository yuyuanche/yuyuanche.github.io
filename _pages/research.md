<li><p><a href="/assets/Seeding Rate Response.pdf">[<b>Seeding Rate Responses to Markets, Resources and Technologies</b>]</a>. <b>Yuyuan Che</b>, David A. Hennessy, and Hongli Feng. </p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Corn and soybean seeding rates in the United States have moved in opposite directions over recent decades, with the former trending upward and the latter trending downward. This paper aims to better understand how farmers’ seeding rate choices for these two different crops respond to market, technological and environmental factors that both seed markets have experienced. We develop a theoretical model of seeding rate choices by incorporating a resource budget trade-off between seeds and resources allocated to each seed. With a large and detailed U.S. farm-level market dataset covering 1995-2016 for corn and 1996-2016 for soybean, we assess how farmers’ seeding rate choices respond to different stimuli. We find the soybean seeding rate choice to be more price elastic than that for corn in theory and with market data based empirical analysis. Furthermore, most inputs that are embodied with land, and so are shared across all seeds (e.g., soil nutrients), increase both corn and soybean seeding rates; while seed-embodied inputs (e.g., genetically engineered treatment) increase corn rates but decrease soybean rates. The difference in price elasticities across crops due to different plant architectures has diverse implications, including for division of economic surplus arising from innovations and for mitigation of negative ecological impacts from seed use. </p></li>

<li><p><b>Estimating Stochastic Production Functions with Linear Inequality Constraints. Yuyuan Che</b>, Sujit K. Ghosh, and Roderick M. Rejesus. </p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> This study develops moment-based parametric methods that accommodate linear inequality constraints when estimating stochastic production functions for production risk analysis. The estimation procedures developed are based on a frequentist and a Bayesian framework, which are respectively called Inequality Constrained Least Squares (ICLS) and Bayesian Inequality Constrained Least Squares (BICLS). Monte Carlo simulation results suggest that our proposed methods perform much better than traditional unconstrained moment-based procedures in terms of lower mean squared errors, variances, and standard errors for the parameter estimates. In addition, the superiority of the ICLS and BICLS procedures are empirically illustrated using long-term corn production data from university field trials that examine the performance of genetically modified (GM) corn varieties on experimental fields. Specifically, the proposed approaches with linear inequality constraints are used to examine the production risk effects of selected GM variety variables and a planting density variable. </p></li>

<li><p><b>Cover Crops and Climate Risks: An Application of Causal Random Forests.</b> David Quigley, <b>Yuyuan Che</b>, Mahmut Yasar, and Roderick M. Rejesus. </p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> This study applies the causal random forest approach to investigate the extent to which persistent warming temperatures might induce farmers to utilize cover crops. Causal random forests is a novel statistical approach that allows for consistent and flexible estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects. The causal random forest technique is then applied to a unique satellite-based panel data set on cover crop adoption at pixel-level resolution. On average, we find evidence that being exposed to higher-than-average maximum temperatures at the end of the harvest season for multiple consecutive years influences farmers’ decisions to utilize cover crops. Moreover, our causal random forest analysis suggests that there is heterogeneity in the effect of persistent end-of-season heat events, and the heterogeneity is likely driven by precipitation and drought conditions at different points of the growing season. The evidence points to farmers increasingly utilizing cover crops voluntarily as weather patterns associated with global warming become increasingly common. </p></li>
